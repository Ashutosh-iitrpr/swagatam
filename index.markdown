# FAQ


**1. Is there a fee for accommodations and food, or are they included in the workshop?**

We will cover everything. You will be our guest. This is sponsored by IIT Ropar :). You should pay a safety deposit of Rs. 1000/- which will be refunded in two days.


**2. What is the limit of Students who can attend this workshop?**

We are trying to accommodate as much as it is possible. There is no cap as such. We will take a call based on the number of participants.

**3. Can parents come or should only the students come alone?**

Parents are welcome to join their kids. But they should manage accommodation outside the campus. There are a few hotels in Ropar district which are good.

**4. How does the accommodation work during the workshop?**

All the students will be provided with shared accommodation. They will get a good glimpse of what it means to stay in the hostels of an IIT.
