1. Is there a fee for accommodations and food, or are they included in the workshop?

This initiative is sponsored by IIT Ropar and is exclusively for meritorious students with a good CRL rank in JEE. We've got everything covered for you. Be our guest! A refundable safety deposit of Rs. 1000 is required, which will be returned within two days. Food and accommodation charges for the student will be borne by us.

2. What is the limit on the number of students who can attend this workshop?

The number is tentative. We are planning to accommodate as many as possible. If you have received an email stating that you are selected, please pack your bags and arrive on time.

3. Can parents come, or should only the students attend alone?

Parents are welcome to visit the campus. However, please note that their accommodation and food are to be managed by themselves. There are great hotels around IIT Ropar for a comfortable stay and plenty of dining options in the cafeteria or nearby.

4. How does the accommodation work during the workshop?

All students will be provided with shared accommodation in the student hostel. They will get a good glimpse of what it means to stay in the hostels of an IIT and develop a strong sense of friendship with their roommates.

5. Is the workshop available online, or is it only offline?

The workshop is also available in online mode. More details will be shared soon, so stay tuned! Whether you prefer to join us in person or from the comfort of your home, we've got you covered.

6. Is the travel fee reimbursed?

No, we regret to inform you that we won't be able to reimburse your travel expenses.

7. The scorecards of the JEE Advanced are yet to be released. How do I provide proof of my score?

If the scorecards are yet to be released, you can submit a screenshot of your provisional score. This will suffice as proof of your eligibility. Once the official scorecards are available, you can update your submission if required. We want to ensure everyone who qualifies has the opportunity to participate.

8. Can we join the workshop even if we are joining another IIT?

Yes, indeed! We would appreciate it if you join an IIT other than IIT Ropar and still attend the workshop. This will give you hands-on experience of being in a different IIT and help you learn about the unique aspects of IIT Ropar. It's a fantastic opportunity to broaden your perspective and experience the vibrant campus life of another IIT.

9. How do we pay the fee for the workshop?

The procedure will be communicated as soon as the final list of students is declared. So, stay tuned and keep an eye on your emails. We will provide detailed instructions to ensure a smooth and hassle-free payment process.

10. When will the list of selected students be released?

Very soon! As mentioned, keep checking your emails for updates. We are working diligently to finalize the list and will notify all selected students promptly.
